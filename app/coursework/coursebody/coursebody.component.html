  <p class="px-2 garamond"> Along with my computer science coursework completed during my undergrad are many online courses that I complete during my spare time to learn new technologies or refine old ones. On the right hand side of a course element below is the name of the institution that course is from. The list goes as far back to my first programming class where I produced my first "Hello, World!" (if only programming had remained that simple). Feel free to check them out and note that courses may be filtered by institution with the click of a button! Perhaps you're only interested in what I did in academia, or what I decide to learn online through my own aspirations.
<!--    Here are the courses that I feel have contributed to my growth as a developer, going as far back to the first programming class I ever took where I printed out my first "Hello, World!"
