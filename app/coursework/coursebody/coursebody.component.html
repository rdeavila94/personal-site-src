  <p class="px-2 garamond"> Along with my computer science coursework completed during my undergrad are many online courses that I enroll in to supplement and continue to grow my development toolbox. Below is a list of courses that I have completed with its respective institution to the right of the course name. The list goes as far back to when I was introduced to programming and I produced my first "Hello, World!" (if only programming had remained that simple). Feel free to check them out and note that courses may be filtered by institution with the click of a button!<br> <span class="font-weight-bold">Courses from CSULB typically cover material on computer science fundamentals, whereas courses from Udacity and Udemy typically cover specialized subjects and material more appropriate for industry.</span>
