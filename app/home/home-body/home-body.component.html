<h1 class="text-dark text-center">Profession</h1>
<p class="px-4">I am a developer at LTI (Larsen & Toubro Infotech) working on a project for a client in the broadcasting and film industries. I am located in the greater Los Angeles region. I received my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Web Technologies from California State University, Long Beach in 2017. My development stack primarily consists of <span class="font-weight-bold">Java, Spring, Hibernate</span> and commonly combined technologies (<span class="font-weight-bold">Maven, Thymeleaf, JSP</span>, etc.) for server-side and <span class="font-weight-bold"> Angular</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold"> Bootstrap</span> for client-side. Other languages and tools I use for personal projects and undertakings are C++, Python, Tensorflow and NumPy, oftentimes for machine learning and AI related purposes. It's commonly said that if you do what you love you never work a day in your life, and I thoroughly enjoy my profession.
