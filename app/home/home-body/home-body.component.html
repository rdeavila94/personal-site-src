<p class="px-4">I hold a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Web Technologies from California State University, Long Beach. I am most proficient in <span class="font-weight-bold"> Java, C++ and Python</span>. My framework of choice is <span class="font-weight-bold">Spring</span> with JSP, Hibernate, Tomcat, and Maven for build automation. My front-end development toolbox consists of the usual <span class="font-weight-bold"> HTML, CSS, JS + Bootstrap</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold"> Angular 4</span>. I am highly versatile and able to learn new technologies suitable for different undertakings i.e. I wanted a single page personal site so I learned Angular. I code on a near daily basis as I believe you learn best by <span class="font-italic">doing</span> and it allows you to explore new technologies and become familiar with different ways of accomplishing like tasks.
