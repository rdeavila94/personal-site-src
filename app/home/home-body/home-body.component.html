<h1 class="text-dark text-center">Profession</h1>
<p class="garamond px-4">My language of choice for software development is Java, though I am also experienced in C++ and Python, having taught a lab course myself in the latter. I would consider myself a<span class="bold"> full-stack developer with a preference for back-end.</span> I am also knowledgeable in front-end, having built this website myself with Bootstrap and Angular4. My minor in <a href="#">Web Technologies and Applications</a> was entirely front-end material (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).My framework of choice is Spring with Hibernate for ORM, Tomcat for web containment, and Maven for build automation (how typical). I learned some of these technologies the difficult way which allowed me to grasp what they do behind the scenes i.e. JDBC applications without ORM (those lines of SQL statements were just hideous) and manually configuring Spring applications through their XML (that was even worse than the JDBC). </p>
