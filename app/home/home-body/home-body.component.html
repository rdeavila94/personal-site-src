<h1 class="text-dark text-center">Profession</h1>
<p class="px-4">I hold a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Web Technologies from California State University, Long Beach. My language of choice for software development is Java, though I am also experienced in C++ and Python, having taught a lab course in the latter myself. My framework of choice is <span class="font-weight-bold">Spring</span> with JSP, Hibernate for ORM, Tomcat for web containment, and Maven for build automation (how typical). My front-end development toolbox consists of Bootstrap and Angular4. Prior to acquiring these skills I had developed applications the hard way: JDBC projects with manually written SQL statements and Spring projects without automated building. This knowledge ultimately allowed me to grasp what these technologies are doing behind the scenes, which is always a plus in software development. I am highly versatile and able to learn new technologies suitable for different undertakings i.e. I wanted a single page personal site, so I learned Angular.
