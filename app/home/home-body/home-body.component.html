<h1 class="text-dark text-center">Profession</h1>
<p class="px-4">I hold a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Web Technologies from California State University, Long Beach. My language of choice for software development is Java, though I am also experienced in C++ and Python. My framework of choice is <span class="font-weight-bold">Spring</span> with JSP, Hibernate, Tomcat, and Maven for build automation. My front-end development toolbox consists of the usual <span class="font-weight-bold"> HTML, CSS, JS + Bootstrap</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold"> Angular4</span>. I am highly versatile and able to learn new technologies suitable for different undertakings i.e. I wanted a single page personal site so I learned Angular. I code on a near daily basis and maintain a skill set that's up-to-date. Now that you know more about my trade, check out the rest of the content on my site!</p>
