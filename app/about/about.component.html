    <p> Interested in knowing more about me outside of the professional bubble? No problem! I'm a very laid back person with many interests and passions. I spend a significant amount of my time on professional growth, with the reason being that I enjoy the feeling of productivity and cannot stand a prolonged amount of time without learning something new. Nevertheless, when I do decide to enjoy my time at my leisure and put away the IDE my preferred activities are: boxing, general exercise, lone drives, Latin dancing, playing video games, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">blowing my money on all you can eat sushi</span>, and just having aimless chats with people.
