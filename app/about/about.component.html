    <p> Interested in knowing more about me outside of the professional bubble? No problem! I'm a very laid back person with many interests and passions. I love what I do and thus I consider coding among my favorite hobbies. Nevertheless, when I do decide to put away the IDE my leisure activities of choice are: boxing, general exercise, lone drives, Latin dancing, playing video games, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">spending my money on all you can eat sushi</span>, and having aimless chats with folk.
