  I have always maintained a robust social life and believe it's vital to interact with people (outside of text messages). I like to meet people and engage in <span class="font-italic">social activities.</span> I have been an athletic person for as far back as I can remember, with boxing being the sport closest to my heart. I have been boxing since the age of 15 and have endured one too many fractures. During my undergrad I was president of the CSULB Boxing Club where I trained youngsters in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweet_Science">sweet science</a> and managed the organization. After a plethora of injuries I no longer box like I used to and now prefer 'safer' sports , particularly swimming. Another of my favorite physical activities is dancing. I dance to Latin music (salsa, bachata, merengue, cumbia... +1 if you know what these are) and can figure out some moves to almost anything. When it comes to non-physical activities I enjoy playing video games and watching interesting TV series (the latest is Game of Thrones). My favorite games are those from the Zelda and Elder Scrolls universe. My favorite games from each are Majoras Mask and Morrowind (Skyrim on Sundays), respectively. There is also a relatively unknown game called Jet Set Radio Future (+2 if you've heard of it) that is extremely dear to me. If you'd like to know anything else or would like to chat just send me a message, I'm always game. <span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span>
